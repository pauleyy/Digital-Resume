				<h3 id="school">studying Computer Science</h3>
				<p>Every <strong>March 11</strong>, I celebrate my annual grow-a-year-older day. <strong>19 years</strong> living, my current highest.  </p>
				<p>4 years of it was spent in high school at <strong>St. Bridget School Quezon City</strong>.</p>
				<p>Another 3 years is being spent in college at <strong>De La Salle University</strong>. One more year till graduation! </p>
				<p>Commuting is a harsh reality when you study in DLSU and live in <strong>Marikina</strong>. It takes about an hour or so just to arrive at school. Commuting grows on you, though. You'll learn to like it.</p>

					<h2>FOOD</h2>
					<p> Food is my first love. It started at and early age and still continue today. My body is an evidence of the love. I also like baking cupcakes. My sweet tooth usually craves for cupcakes and chocolates. That is the main reason I tried baking. </p>
				</div>
				<div id="books" class="grid_4">
					<img src="images/books.png"  width="auto" height="200px">
					<h2>BOOKS</h2>
					<p> I love books. I have a special relationship with them. They make me experience emotions and adventures that would be impossible in real life. I usually read fiction but as long as it's good, I read. Not too much on school books, though. </p>
				</div>
				<div id="music" class="grid_4">
					<img src="images/music.png"  width="auto" height="200px">
					<h2>MUSIC</h2>
					<p> Who doesn't love music? It's just too good to not love. There's something for everyone. Personally, I listen to bands. Not much into pop but there's the occasional 'I like that song' moment. I'm into the Wicked Soundtrack, currently. I have a Wicked hangover! </p>
				</div>
				<div id="tech" class="grid_4">
					<img src="images/phone.png" width="auto" height="200px">
					<h2>TECHNOLOGY</h2>
					<p> Technology and innovation, it's the reason why my degree exists. Learning about new technologies makes me believe that my childhood fantasies would come true. It makes me feel proud that I could be part of turning to reality. </p>

					<img src="images/keyboard.png" width="auto" height="200px">
					<p> I learned programming in <strong>C</strong>. <strong>Java</strong> came after I learned the basics from C. Then, database came along. <strong>MySQL</strong> became my friend. Now, <strong>HTML</strong> and <strong>CSS</strong> make my websites pretty. They are such a cute pair. Also, <strong>Python</strong> recently came along. I'm actually loving it. Loving them all, actually. </p>

					<img src="images/monitor.png" width="auto" height="200px">
					<p> I'm an Apple user for 3 years. My baby is a Macbook Pro 2010. Being an Apple user, I'm quite versed in using Mac OS X. I started at Snow Leopard up to the current one, Mavericks. I still use Windows, though. I use it to run strictly Windows software. I have a Windows 8.1 virtual machine in my laptop. Yay for VMs! In handheld device, I use an Android phone, HTC One X. I do have an iPad that I could use whenever I like. Best of both worlds. </p>
				</div>
				<div id="software" class="grid_4">
					<img src="images/mouse.png" width="auto" height="200px">
					<p> To help in the tasks I do, I have softwares that would make my a little more hassle-free. I have Microsoft Office and Apple iWork. I use both. It depends on the task, though, which one of the two choose. For Java programming, I use Eclipse. It's lightweight and easy to use. Partner it with Git and you have a collaborative project. I use Sublime Text for other programming languages. </p>
